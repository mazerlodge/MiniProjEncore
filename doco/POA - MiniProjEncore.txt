    - Fleshing out UGE.doAction:player() method (Use case F0)
        -- Next, workig in case PlayerActionShow, flesh out UGE.doActionShow:player() method 

	- Determine if Odds OFF is handled correctly
		Scenario: 1st and 2nd points established, 1st is hit.  On come out roll, odds bet on 2nd are OFF, if hit on next roll odds returned, come is paid even money.
